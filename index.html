    <h1>The Timelessness of Tetris</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Tetris is one of my favorite games to play,</strong> both with others and on my own. You'd think that a simple game about clearing lines of blocks released in 1984
        and reskinned so many times throughout history would eventually go out of fashion, but something about the way that the game's gradual difficulty curve
        pushes the player to improve their own skills, as well as the community you can build with others while playing the game brings me back to it on multiple occasions.

        expresses a similarly profound respect and fondness for the game.
